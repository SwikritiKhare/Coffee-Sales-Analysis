# ***âœ… Future Recommendations***

**ðŸŽ¯ Target Promotions During Peak Hours**

Focus marketing between 10 AM to 12 PM, when sales are highest.

Offer combo deals during those hours to increase per-ticket revenue.

**ðŸ“† Leverage May-Like Trends**

Investigate what drove Mayâ€™s high sales (weather, events, campaigns) and replicate similar strategies in other months.

**ðŸ†• Upsell High-Margin Products**

Promote Latte, Americano with Milk, and Cappuccino more visibly â€” these are customer favorites with high revenue impact.

**ðŸ“‰ Reconsider Low-Performing Items**

Reevaluate or reinvent Espresso and Cocoa offerings â€” possibly with flavors, bundling, or removal.

**ðŸ’¡ Personalize Offers Using Filters**

Use day-type and payment preference data to send personalized offers (e.g., "Weekend Latte Loyalty Card Discount").

**ðŸ“² Optimize Mobile Ordering**

Given the clear peak hour, enabling fast mobile or pre-orders could reduce wait times and improve customer experience.
